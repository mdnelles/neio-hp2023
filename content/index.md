Thank you for taking the time to view my personal website. I am a remote-work-only web developer with over 6 years experience. My current preferred stack includes, but is not limited to, React(NextJS), Node(Nest), SQL/NoSQL Type/Javascript. I have completed extensive work in Fintech and have successfully parlayed that into Biotech and other industries.
